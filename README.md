### Meet spicebot: the jankiest and least original Discord bot known to man

## What can it do?

1. Connect to Discord
    1. That's it.

## History

For those of you that don't know, this bot is a precursor to my much better and much bigger bot [`regulad/PepperCord`](https://github.com/regulad/PepperCord).

This project kickstarted my interest in computer science, and made my love computing. I cannot be thankful enough. 

This repository is maintained as a history museum of sorts.
